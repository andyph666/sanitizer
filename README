Executable Name: sanitizer

Makefile targets are as specified in the assignment, with the addition of make
format, which formats everything according to Google Style Guide.

The program reads lines in the format <filename> <data_field> from stdin and
outputs the data_fields to the files specified by filename if both fields are
valid and the file is within either the current directory or "tmp." It fails on
that line silently otherwise.

NOTE: invalid escape sequences are simply output with the correct value (e.g.
"\a" becomes "a"). This simplified my quotation parsing.
